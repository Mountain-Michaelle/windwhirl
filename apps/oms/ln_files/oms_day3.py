# WINDWHIRL OMS — DAY 3: PASSIVE MESSAGE OBSERVER

# ARCHITECTURE:
#   Browser → SessionManager → (navigate to group) →
#   RecoveryManager → (startup catch-up) →
#   DOMObserver → (live watching) →
#   RawMessage → EventDispatcher → (Day 4 classifier picks up here)
#
# CORE DESIGN DECISION — MutationObserver via JS injection:
#   Instead of Playwright polling (checking every N seconds),
#   we inject a real JavaScript MutationObserver into the page.
#   When WhatsApp inserts a new message node into the DOM,
#   the JS fires immediately and queues it for Python to read.
#   Python reads the queue every 2 seconds via page.evaluate().
#   This is event-driven on the JS side — no message is missed
#   between polls because the JS buffers everything.
#
#   Polling interval: 2 seconds (only to drain the JS queue)
#   Detection latency: ~0ms (JS fires on DOM mutation)
#   CPU impact: minimal (no busy-wait, no selector scanning)
#
# RESPONSIBILITY BOUNDARY:
#   Everything in Day 3 stops at RawMessage + events.
#   No order detection. No parsing. No classification.
#   Day 4 (classifier) consumes "message.received" events.
# ==============================================================

#  FILE 1
#  PATH: windwhirl/app/oms/infrastructure/browser/raw_message.py
# ================================================================
# PURPOSE:
#   Defines RawMessage — the output of the observer layer.
#   Pure data. No business logic. No interpretation.
#
#   Every message the observer sees becomes a RawMessage.
#   Day 4's classifier decides what TYPE of message it is.
#   Day 5's parser extracts structured data from order messages.
#   Today we only capture and fingerprint.
#
# NOTE ON DOMAIN vs INFRASTRUCTURE:
#   Day 1 defined a domain RawMessage in domain/entities.py.
#   This infrastructure RawMessage is the SAME concept but
#   carries additional infrastructure-specific fields:
#     fingerprint, dom_reference, captured_at, direction.
#   Day 4 will convert infrastructure RawMessage → domain RawMessage
#   when passing to the application layer.
#   Keeping them separate respects the domain/infra boundary.

# PURPOSE:
#   Lightweight in-memory cache of recently seen message fingerprints.

#
# WHY AN IN-MEMORY CACHE (not database):
#   The duplicate check happens in the hot path — every message
#   that arrives goes through this cache. It must be O(1).
#   A database lookup per message would be too slow and would
#   create unnecessary I/O during live observation.
#
#   The cache is bounded in size (max_size). When full, the
#   oldest fingerprints are evicted. This is safe because:
#     - The database (Day 5) handles long-term deduplication
#     - The cache only needs to cover the current session window
#     - Evicted fingerprints represent old messages unlikely to reappear
#
# THREAD SAFETY:
#   asyncio is single-threaded — no locks needed.

# PURPOSE:
#   Catches up on messages missed while the OMS was offline.
#   Runs ONCE at startup, before the live observer begins.
#   Never runs while the live observer is active.
#
# RECOVERY ALGORITHM:
#   1. Load checkpoint history from CheckpointStore
#   2. Calculate offline duration
#   3. If offline > RECOVERY_MAX_AGE_HOURS → skip recovery
#   4. Read currently visible messages in the group chat
#   5. Search for any checkpoint fingerprint in visible messages
#   6. If found → replay only messages newer than the checkpoint
#   7. If not found → scroll up and repeat
#   8. Stop when: checkpoint found OR max scrolls reached
#
# DESIGN RULES FROM DAY 3 PROMPT:
#   - Recovery runs ONLY during startup
#   - Recovery NEVER runs while live observer is active
#   - Stop after RECOVERY_MAX_SCROLLS regardless of result
#   - Never crash — log warning and start live observer

# PURPOSE:
#   Passively watches for new messages in the open WhatsApp group.
#   Starts AFTER recovery completes.
#   Runs continuously until stopped.
#
# DETECTION METHOD — JavaScript MutationObserver:
#   A real JavaScript MutationObserver is injected into the page.
#   It watches the chat message container for DOM mutations.
#   When WhatsApp inserts a new message node, the JS fires
#   immediately and appends the message data to a queue.
#   Python polls this queue every 2 seconds to drain it.
#
#   This is NOT polling the DOM for selectors every 2 seconds.
#   The JS detects the mutation instantly (0ms latency).
#   Python drains the queue every 2 seconds (minimal CPU).
#   Messages are never missed between Python polls because
#   the JS buffers everything.
#
# PASSIVE PRINCIPLE:

class DOMObserver:
    '''
    Live observer that detects new WhatsApp messages via MutationObserver.

    Injects a JavaScript MutationObserver into the WhatsApp Web page.
    The JS fires immediately when a new message node is added to the DOM.
    Python polls the JS message queue every POLL_INTERVAL seconds.

    This design means:
      - Detection latency: ~0ms (JS reacts to DOM mutation instantly)
      - Python overhead: POLL_INTERVAL seconds (only to drain the queue)
      - No selector scanning in the Python poll loop
      - No missed messages (JS buffers everything between Python polls)

    Usage:
        observer = DOMObserver(page, cache, checkpoint_store, cfg)
        task = asyncio.create_task(observer.run())
        # ... later ...
        await observer.stop()
